# Executive Report  
            The purpose of this project is to formulate a model that can predict fraudulent 
             transactions from the given set of transactions.

# About the Data 

      The data used for this model was taken from Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud  

# EDA

* The data was heavily imbalanced: 492 Frauds among 284807 datapoints 
* Had around thirty-one variables: thirty of them PCA and rest normal.
* Skewed distributions
* No Null Values or any prominent anomalies.

# Methodology 
Based on the EDA the following steps were taken
* Create a subset of data with 492 Frauds and 492 Non-Frauds.
* Scale Time and Amount to make it normally distributed.
* Use Stratified Kfold to split the original data to train and test
* Create a correlation heatmap on the balanced dataset. 
* Run VIF and decision Forrest to identify the most important predictors. 

# Analysis 
* By performing EDA of subset-data i.e. New_df, the relation between the variables became more legible.
* The dimension was reduced in different iterations using VIF, Decision Tree and Random Forrest Classification. 
* Based on the dimension reduction techniques, the variables 'Class','V4','V10','V11','V12','V14','V16','V17','V19','V20','V27','scaled_amount','scaled_time' are selected for the formulating the model

# Model on Balanced Data 
* Four classifiers were fitted in the New_df with the selected variables. 
* Y= 'Class' X= rest of the variables

Classifiers:
***
> * Logistic Regression Cross Validation Score:  93.65%   > Prediction Score= 93.77%
> * Knears Neighbors Cross Validation Score 93.14%        > Prediction Score= 94.79%
> * Support Vector Classifier Cross Validation Score 92.76% > Prediction Score= 93.9%
> * DecisionTree Classifier Cross Validation Score 91.23% > Prediction Score= 100.0%


# Model on Original Data 
* The Logistic Regression Model created on the balanced data was fitted on the Original Unbalanced data. 
* Before that the Original data was normalized by using SMOTE oversampling technique.
The resulting parameters of the model: 
* > accuracy: 0.9425100695767785
* > precision: 0.061068551743605
* > recall: 0.9162934112301201
* > f1: 0.11271073613773068
